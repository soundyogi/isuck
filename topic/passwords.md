A lot of your passwords probably suck and its not even your fault.

What makes a password safe against bruteforcing?
The _only_ thing that matters is its length.
Thats it. 
Simple.

    PASSWORDPASSWORDPASSWORD 

is a better password than 

    !mydog1234jesus
    
Or how about something you can remember easy like:
    
    <sitename><year of birth><password>

Please, Please, Please spam hatemail (about password restriciton) to any site that enforces something like this

And Please help collect these sites so we can shun them in public :D
